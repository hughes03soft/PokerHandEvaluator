# PokerHandEvaluator
 Poker Hand Evaluator
 
 This project is a technical exam for one of the companies I applied for and passed.

Assumptions: <br />
1. 5 card standard poker rules ((https://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~gc00/reviews/pokerrules) <br />
1.1. no wild cards <br />
1.2. suite is irrelevant to hand rank <br />
2. Assumes input is always correct e.g. set of cards and no duplicates <br />
3. Aside from rank, the evaluator will also identify the hand rank names <br />
4. Since requirement is to impliment 5+ or more poker hands, I'm assuming the design should: <br />
4.1. focus more on making it easy to add new poker hands (as classes) with the least possible risk <br />
4.2. don't focus on optimizing runtime speed (still try to not write slow code if possible) <br />
5. Try to avoid copying poker evaluators online as much as possible <br />
